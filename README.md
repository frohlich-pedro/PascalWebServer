# Pascal Web Server
A complete re-write of my web server made in Java, but now in Pascal.

The simple Pascal syntax and powerful control that FPC (Free Pascal Compiler) grants, could "resurect" Pascal so i took a step in making a Web Server in Pascal, it is really simple, i plan to increase it's functionality.
